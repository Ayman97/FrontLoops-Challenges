        The desire to be respected by someone of the opposite sex is something that runs deep within everyone, even though most peple
        don't take the time to find someone truly respects them. It seems like people are just looking for someone to show
        them the slightest amount of attention, setting for something much less than respect. I am convinced one of the best
        ways to help any relationship fow is by showing respect.
        <br>
        <br> I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be respected. What is respect? Respect is showing someone extra
        special attention, or hight regard, based on a desire to show them how highly they are valued.
